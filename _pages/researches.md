* <b>Climate change and agri-food supply chains competitive and comparative advantages</b>
<br/>
International trade literature often focuses heavily on the production side of general equilibrium,
leaving several empirical puzzles unresolved. For instance, there is significant variation in income
elasticities of food demand across products and countries. In this paper, we develop a general
equilibrium Ricardian model of trade that allows for variation in the income elasticity of demand
for agri-food products. We use this model to quantify the macro-level consequences of climate
change under non-homothetic preferences. Despite heterogeneity, our findings indicate that cli-
mate change induces a 0.06 percent decrease in global welfare, which is considerably lower than
the 0.26 percent decrease observed when income effects are not considered. Additionally, lower-
middle-income countries are found to be especially vulnerable to climate change.
