Welcome to my website ! 
<br/>
<br/>
I am a Ph.D. candidate in economics at Laval university and a member of CREATE !
<br/>
<br/>
Before that, I hold a M.Sc, in Economics and Statistics, and I have worked as an Economist Consultant at the <a target="_self" href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/home">World Bank</a>, as well as Economist at <a target="_self" href="https://agriculture.canada.ca/en">Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
My research interest includes : 
<br/>
<br/>
Public Finance: Environmental taxation, Tax expenditures assessment, Public Finance Management (PFM) assessment.
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Econometrics and Statistics : Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models, Time series econometrics, Panel data analysis.

I use quantitative models to address questions related to the socioeconomics impact of climate change and adaptation strategies. I also work on national representative household surveys to address poverty and inequality questions in developing countries.

<!-- Here I want to share what I am most passionate about, that is, topics of inequality, as well as data science. This website is about the reasons and consequences of poverty and inequality, and about how data science can help to better understand and address it. How can we use data science to achieve what's most important, a decent life for everybody. -->
